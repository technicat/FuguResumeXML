My résumés. Not for storage in recruiter databases.

The [latest](https://github.com/technicat/resume/blob/master/resume.adoc) is in asciidoc (adoc).

The XSL directory has an old stylesheet I used to generate different formats from 
XML.

The keynote directory has some slides I threw together for some students making games.
