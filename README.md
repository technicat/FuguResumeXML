Various old versions of my resume.

The keynote directory has some slides I threw together for some students making games.

The XSL directory has an old stylesheet I used to generate different formats from 
XML.

ThatXSL stuff is open source (MIT License), but not my resume itself (in particular, recruiters, you do not have permission to store and redistribute it).
